CUSTOM PREDICTIVE MODELING DASHBOARD USING SPOTFIRE

Analytics based techniques enables us to improve decision making strategies in real time with help of 
using machine leaning models generated from historical data and analyzing their outcome on real unclassified data.

CAPIOT analytics team have developed an indicative Spotfire Dashboard which can be used to generate, compare and deploy the predictive models. The following are the key components of the dashboard

Perform descriptive analysis of the data
Configure and generate machine learning models
Compare and deploy the most optimal model for generating risk score at real time.
The model is deployed on TIBCO Streambase for real time scoring on streaming data.
